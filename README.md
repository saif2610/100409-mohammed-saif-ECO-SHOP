# 🌍 EcoShop Impact — Full Clean & Premium Version

## Project Overview

**EcoShop Impact** is a feature-rich, exam-ready Streamlit application that simulates an eco-conscious online shopping experience. It allows users to explore products, add them to a cart, visualize their environmental impact, and reflect on sustainability through data-driven insights and interactive visuals.

This version represents a **complete, polished implementation** suitable for **board exams, computer science practicals, project submissions, and demos**.

---

## Core Objectives

* Demonstrate how everyday shopping choices affect the environment
* Promote awareness of **carbon footprints and sustainability**
* Showcase advanced **Streamlit concepts** in a clean, professional format
* Combine UI design, data handling, and visualization in one cohesive app

---

## Key Features

### 🏠 Home Dashboard

* Category-based product navigation
* Clean card-based UI with icons and hover effects
* Direct access to cart

### 🛍️ Product Browsing

* Detailed product cards with pricing
* Add-to-cart functionality
* Instant eco tips to encourage sustainable thinking

### 🛒 Smart Cart System

* Persistent cart using session state
* Automatic total price and total CO₂ calculation
* Date tracking for added items

### 🏅 Eco Badge System

Users earn badges based on shopping behavior:

* 🌱 Eco Saver
* 🐢 Low Impact Shopper
* 🛍️ Conscious Buyer

### 📊 Impact Visualization

* Bar chart showing CO₂ contribution per product
* Clear numerical summaries for easy interpretation

### 🌍 Individual Product Impact Page

* Animated Earth-based CO₂ loading visualization
* Real-world equivalents:

  * Driving distance 🚗
  * Tree offset requirement 🌳
* Suggested greener alternatives when available

---

## Technology Stack

* **Programming Language:** Python 3
* **Framework:** Streamlit
* **Libraries Used:**

  * streamlit
  * pandas
  * matplotlib
  * math
  * time
  * random

---

## Sustainability Logic

* 🚗 **Driving Equivalent:**
  `1 kg CO₂ ≈ 4 km of car travel`

* 🌳 **Tree Offset Estimation:**
  `1 tree absorbs approximately 21 kg of CO₂ per year`

These conversions are simplified for educational clarity.

---

## Installation & Execution

1. Install required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pandas matplotlib
   ```

2. Run the application:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. Open the provided local URL in your browser.

---

## Project Structure

* **Home Page:** Category navigation
* **Products Page:** Add to cart or buy instantly
* **Cart Page:** Summary, badges, and analytics
* **Impact Page:** Animated visualization and sustainability insights

All navigation is managed using `st.session_state`.
